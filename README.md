  <h3 align="center">Enhanced Tic-Tac-Toe Game with Three Players: A Novel Approach to Extended Gameplay Dynamics and Winning Strategies</h3>
</div>

## Problem Statement
The traditional Tic-Tac-Toe game, a classic two-player game played on a 3x3 grid, has been a subject of extensive research in game theory and artificial intelligence. In this paper, we propose an extension of the traditional Tic-Tac-Toe game to accommodate three players, introducing a new coin 'T' alongside the traditional 'X' and 'O'. The game is played on a larger 6x6 grid, offering increased complexity and strategic depth compared to the original version. The objective remains the same: the first player to achieve four consecutive coins in a row, column, or diagonal wins the game. This paper presents the rules, gameplay mechanics, and winning strategies for the extended Tic-Tac-Toe game, along with a simulation of its working. We discuss the implications of introducing a third player and analyze the impact on gameplay dynamics, strategic considerations, and computational complexity. Furthermore, we explore potential applications of the extended Tic-Tac-Toe game in educational settings, cognitive development studies, and AI research.
